  <h1> Advice from a Bloc student after one week </h1>
  
  <h2> This is my first creation.</h2>
  
  <p> I am very excited to learn how to become a web developer. Learning new skills and new techniques will be a journey filled with successes and failures.
    Sometimes learning a new skill as complex as coding languages can be very frustrating. I find that 10 minutes of meditation can be helpful. Listed below is what I find to be helpful to a new developer student.
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li> Keep in mind that the coding langauges are new to you and learning them will take some time. </li>
    <li> There is no room for error in writing code. Be sure to pay close attention to the code that you write. </li>
    <li> Celebrate your victories. Be proud of your success and use it as a tool to persevere. </li>
    <li> Use your mentor, practice, and eventually over time your frustrations will melt away. </li>
    <li> Have fun! Don't take yourself so damn seriously. Education should be challenging but still fun. </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p> If you want to learn how to code and maybe have a new and exciting career in technology consider enrolling in Bloc online coding bootcamp. </p>
